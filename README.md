## Who am I?
I'm a 21 yo software developer from QuerÃ©taro, MÃ©xico. I'm currently studying in the [Universidad TecnolÃ³gica de San Juan Del RÃ­o](https://www.utsjr.edu.mx/) and sometimes I work as a freelancer developer.

## Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸ¤  ... 

Now Iâ€™m just trying to specialize in my strongest skills, such as React and JavaScript, and exploring Python for data analytics :))

## A little bit more about me âœ¨

I love literature too, I think that the literature and poetry are the ways to reach feelings that move our life, I mean, our essence that makes us human. So if you want, follow me in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134372947-marcos-camacho). I never review but maybe one day I will start to.
